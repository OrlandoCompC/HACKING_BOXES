I was given a list of things to do and I will have to perform them as if I was an administrator.

The first thing I need is to RDP into the machine.

• We will use `xfreerdp` to connect with the target.

- IP == 10.129.202.146 (ACADEMY-IAD-DC01)
- Username == `htb-student_adm`
- Password == `Academy_student_DA!`

using the following command I was able to connect 

```
xfreerdp /v:10.129.202.146 (ACADEMY-IAD-DC01) /u:htb-student_adm /p:Academy_student_DA!
```

Now my first task is to add the new hires.

For this I will be using active directory users and computers.

### **Users to Add:**

**User**

---

```
Andromeda Cepheus
```

---

```
Orion Starchaser
```

---

```
Artemis Callisto
```

---

**Attribute**

---

```
full name
```

---

```
email (first-initial.lastname@inlanefreight.local) ( ex.j.smith@inlanefreight.local)
```

---

```
display name
```

---

```
User must change password at next logon
```

---

For now I added the users here before making the next OU

I then went around looking for users that I needed to remove.

**User**

---

```
Mike O'Hare
```

---

```
Paul Valencia
```

---

By going through the Employees OU and searching I managed to find the users and delete them.

Next I have to find a ticket of a lockout user and make him change his password on next logon.

The user is called Adam Masters

I found him by using the search function.

![Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 8.47.39 AM.png](AD%20TRAINING%201%209048ee60ba24421591209d1e49a684a3/Screenshot_2024-09-09_at_8.47.39_AM.png)

My next task now Is to manage the OU’s and the Security Groups.

Now I must make an OU called Analysts and also make a Security Group with the same name.

![Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 8.50.52 AM.png](AD%20TRAINING%201%209048ee60ba24421591209d1e49a684a3/Screenshot_2024-09-09_at_8.50.52_AM.png)

I created the OU and now added the users into it.

The same way I created the OU I also created the Security Group, I went into new and chose group.

![Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 8.53.17 AM.png](AD%20TRAINING%201%209048ee60ba24421591209d1e49a684a3/Screenshot_2024-09-09_at_8.53.17_AM.png)

I then had to add all the users into this newly created group.

I  also decided to remove the initials from the name because it would make it easier to search these users and from what I saw around the enviroment users just had their name and last name.

![Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 8.58.16 AM.png](AD%20TRAINING%201%209048ee60ba24421591209d1e49a684a3/Screenshot_2024-09-09_at_8.58.16_AM.png)

Next, we have been asked to duplicate the group policy `Logon Banner`, rename it `Security Analysts Control`, and modify it to work for the new Analysts OU.

We will need to change the mpassword policy and allow these users to use powershell and cmd because this is needed for them to complete their jobs.

Also need to make sure that removable media is blocked from access.

I then created a new GPO and edited

![Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 9.17.35 AM.png](AD%20TRAINING%201%209048ee60ba24421591209d1e49a684a3/Screenshot_2024-09-09_at_9.17.35_AM.png)

![Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 9.18.50 AM.png](AD%20TRAINING%201%209048ee60ba24421591209d1e49a684a3/Screenshot_2024-09-09_at_9.18.50_AM.png)

Now that this is enabled the next is the command prompt access.

This is located i the system section

![image.png](AD%20TRAINING%201%209048ee60ba24421591209d1e49a684a3/image%201.png)

![Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 9.20.55 AM.png](AD%20TRAINING%201%209048ee60ba24421591209d1e49a684a3/Screenshot_2024-09-09_at_9.20.55_AM.png)

This one I set to disabled because I want my users to have access.

My next step is to go into the computers section. I need to modify policies affecting the logon banner.

Next I go back into the security settings and go into the Password Policy Section.
