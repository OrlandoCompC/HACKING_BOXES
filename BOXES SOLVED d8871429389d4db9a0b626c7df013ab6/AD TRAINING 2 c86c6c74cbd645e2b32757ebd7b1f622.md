# AD TRAINING 2

---

This is the part 2 of the previous Active Directory Lab I did.

Here I will be adding computers into the domain.

Here I have to RDP into the non-domain-joined hosts.

- IP == 10.129.103.116 (ACADEMY-IAD-WIN10) ,10.129.180.138 (ACADEMY-IAD-DC01)
- Username == `image`
- Password == `Academy_student_AD!`

Now that I have access to the machine I go to the control panel.

In the systems and security section.

After adding the domain I was asked to enter my domain credentials which I previously had.

I then moved it into the OU I previously created.
