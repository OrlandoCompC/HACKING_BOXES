I always like to start with an nmap scan,

```
┌─[us-academy-5]─[10.10.14.179]─[htb-ac-1456674@htb-pjfx5lz9km]─[~]
└──╼ [★]$ sudo nmap -sU --script ipmi-version -p 623 10.129.253.128

```

Another way I can do this is with metasploit

Here I use this module to dump the hash transmitted by the server. The username is the admin and now I can try to crack this hash.

```
admin:5c35d3cf8200000059d6c41fe645e38b2866f70ba3fc1b216842c9bff53f14aec01ea9c6f34a66eba123456789abcdefa123456789abcdef140561646d696e:d913526e219ea4b62e0b39fd3351d2c247c72e07
```

the mode for this is 

```
7300 | IPMI2 RAKP HMAC-SHA1 | Network Protocol
```

With this I got a valid username and password. If this was a real test then i would attempt to check for password reuse because administrators often like to reuse passwords.
