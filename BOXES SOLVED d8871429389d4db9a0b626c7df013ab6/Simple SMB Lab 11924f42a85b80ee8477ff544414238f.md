# Simple SMB Lab

---

Here I have to enumerate SMB and find a few things about it.

The first thing I do is use nmap one it.

```

```

Im being asked 

```
What version of the SMB server is running on the target system?

The answer is:
Samba smbd 4.6.2
```

the next question is 

```
What is the name of the accessible share on the target?
```

For this I will use crackmap exec simply because I have this tool multiple times at work and want to get better at it.

Here we can see the sambashare is accessible.

Now I need to connect to it.

To do this I will use smbclient.

Here I am able to access it and try and find the flag. I could have also done something similar with crackmapexec but I chose not to in this case.

HTB{o873nz4xdo873n4zo873zn4fksuhldsf}

```

Now I need to find which domain the server belongs to.

For this I will use enum4linux-ng and use it to enumerate.

Now to get more info on the share I will go into rcpclient.

```
rpcclient $> netshareenumall
netname: print$
	remark:	Printer Drivers
	path:	C:\var\lib\samba\printers
	password:	
netname: sambashare
	remark:	InFreight SMB v3.1
	path:	C:\home\sambauser\
	password:	
netname: IPC$
	remark:	IPC Service (InlaneFreight SMB server (Samba, Ubuntu))
	path:	C:\tmp
	password:	
rpcclient $> 

```

The answer for  What is the full system path of that specific share? (format: "/directory/names")

is /home/sambauser

Now I need to find additional info about the share. To do this I just kept using RPC and did 

```
rpcclient $> netsharegetinfo sambashare
netname: sambashare
	remark:	InFreight SMB v3.1
	path:	C:\home\sambauser\
