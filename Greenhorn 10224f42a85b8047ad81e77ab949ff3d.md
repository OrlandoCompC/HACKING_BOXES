![image.png](Greenhorn%2010224f42a85b8047ad81e77ab949ff3d/image%202.png)

so ssh:22, http:80, and a unknown service on port 3000

since there is web server lets do  file path enumeration with ffuf â€”>

output:

## Visiting the Site

going to `/login.php` 

![image.png](Greenhorn%2010224f42a85b8047ad81e77ab949ff3d/image%208.png)

we can see `pluck 4.7.18` lets look for exploits.

there is a **RCE**

While I look for RCE there also seems to be path traversal to some extent.

While looking at the login page there also seemed to be an information disclosure vulnerability as the application would say if the password was incorrect.

To try and exploit this Burp Intruder was used with a Seclists password list.

While attempting to brute force there was limit rate, Now I will attempt to use X-Forwarded-For header to bypass it.

While this was going on. I took a closer look at GitTea

**lets vists the applicaiton on the port 3000**

now that we can access the site lets go to that interesting dir from earlier:

`path: data/settings/` 

![image.png](Greenhorn%2010224f42a85b8047ad81e77ab949ff3d/image%2015.png)

The password was iloveyou1 

With this access to the website was possible and now the POC from the cve can be used.

After logging in, the poc script was used to gain access.

After using linpeas the user Junior was found as well mysql
