```

I used Stealth scan but this will not work because SNMP uses UDP.

```
sudo nmap -sU -Pn -sV -p161 10.129.18.129

I did this because when I originally ran it , It outputed a bunch of info so I thought it would be better to do it like this.

```
snmpwalk -v2c -c public 10.129.18.129
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 = STRING: "Linux NIX02 5.4.0-90-generic #101-Ubuntu SMP Fri Oct 15 20:00:55 UTC 2021 x86_64"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 = OID: iso.3.6.1.4.1.8072.3.2.10
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0 = Timeticks: (28782) 0:04:47.82
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0 = STRING: "devadmin <devadmin@inlanefreight.htb>"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 = STRING: "NIX02"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0 = STRING: "InFreight SNMP v0.91"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.7.0 = INTEGER: 72

```

as can be seen I was able to find the email address of the admin.

There is also a customized version which is 

```
InFreight SNMP v0.91
```

to look for the custom script that was running I just looked at the output of my snmp.txt and used grep to see which output I wanted.

I managed to get the flag and complete the challenge.
